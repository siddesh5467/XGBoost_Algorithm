# XGBoost_Algorithm
# XGBoost Algorithm – Machine Learning Model

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a regression model using the *XGBoost algorithm*. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook covers:

* Importing required Python libraries
* Loading and cleaning the dataset
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
* Building an XGBoost regression model
* Evaluating performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error
* Saving the model using pickle

## 📁 Files Included

* *XGboost_Algorithm.ipynb* – Jupyter Notebook containing all code for training and evaluating the model
* Additional files generated during execution (model pickle file, metrics output, etc.)

## ⚙ Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:


pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
pickle5


You can install them using:


pip install -r requirements.txt


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project
2. Install dependencies
3. Open the notebook:


jupyter notebook XGboost_Algorithm.ipynb


4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The notebook prints key performance metrics like:

* *R² Score*
* *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*

These metrics help you understand how well the model fits the data.
